this document details the PC-side converter and formats, see "info.txt" for the GBA side
this is not intended to be an absolute documentation, i have only looked deeply into what's necessary to take a gba rom, get a script from it, and re-compile it

all values are little endian. data sizes are such:
word - 2 bytes
dword - 4 bytes



the executable is just a shell, all it does is create a temp dir (%Temp%/GCA____.tmp), extract its files to it, run the real executable, wait until it finishes, then clean everything up
an extractor program is not necessary, just open task manager while it's running to find the files, then copy them somewhere else


map of extracted files (only important specific files are listed):
exe/    - misc tools
res2/   - resources that cannot be retrieved from the original game CD
resrin/ - pc-side resources
minagi.bin  - the game engine part of the ROM
mint.exe    - script compiler
rinnr.exe   - main executable


minagi.bin is identical to the start of the rom, except the game name is "MiNAGIforADV", code is "MNGA", and version is 0


the main exe reads the game CD, converts its files into native mint formats, generates a script and calls mint.exe to compile it
it is also used after the game is compiled to generate the keycode to enter when the game is run
to generate the code, the exe looks into your system's network config and account/pc name, and this information is saved in detail in the script. this has the unfortunate side effect of having to regenerate the rom if any of these things happen to change
in the manual the devs claim that the information stored would allow them to catch anyone who spreads their copy, but that sounds like a bluff to me, considering all the ip addresses it stores are local...
generated resources are placed in %Temp%/_Rin01, but the folder is wiped on error and when the process finishes, so capturing its contents is not very easy...


mint.exe builds the final game from a script file that the main exe creates
usage: mint <scriptname> <resfolder> <resfolder2> <outname> minayochan
    scriptname is the name of the generated script file (%Temp%/_Rin01/_stemp.txt)
    resfolder is the resource folder that was created by the main exe (%Temp%/_Rin01)
    resfolder2 is the built-in resource folder (the res2 directory)
    outname is the name of the output rom file
    minayochan is just the text "minayochan". the tool will fail silently if this is wrong












MFO format (font):
dword - amount of chars
dword - char width
dword - char height
dword - length of each char pattern in bytes

xx words - shiftjis char list, in reverse byte order

the rest of the file is the 1bpp pattern data for each char




MGA format (image):
identical to the image format described in info.txt



MCR format (???):



ADP format (sampled audio):
identical to the sound effect format described in info.txt



MUS format (sequenced music):
identical to the music format described in info.txt



INST format (instruments):
dword - size of following data
rest is the same as the instrument list described in info.txt
