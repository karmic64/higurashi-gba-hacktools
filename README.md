# higurashi-gba-hacktools

Eventually, this repository will contain tools to extract and rebuild the scripts of Inside-cap's Higurashi no Naku Koro ni GBA port (and possibly others), so we can all enjoy it in English. But for now, all there is is an incomplete technical reference and a protection cracking/ROM header repair tool. Please be patient!

## Thanks

I wish to thank the following people/groups for their (indirect) assistance in making this a possibility:
* Ryukishi07 - for making the game
* Inside-cap - for allowing on-the-go visual novel reading in a pre-phone world, and giving me a nice boredom-killer
* Unknown person(s) - for spreading their ROMs of several Inside-cap games
* "DJ" - for somehow figuring out how to remove the protection from the scripts
* [07th-Mod](https://07th-mod.com/) - for providing their source scripts which all the text was ripped from
* [Higurashi Archive](https://twitter.com/FurudeJinja) - for supplying the PC converter software
* [Nicolate](https://twitter.com/NicoIate) - for assuring me that there is at least one other person in the world who would actually be interested in this
